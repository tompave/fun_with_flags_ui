  # The most common use case for this library is to embed it in
  # a host web application and serve it from a sub path: it should
  # just be plug'ed into a Phoenix or Plug router.
  # In that case, there is no need to start :fun_with_flags_ui as
  # its own application, as the Router plug will be managed as a simpl
  # termination plug for the host's HTTP handler.
  #
  # The commented out `mod: {}` configuration, below, is provided just
  # as _an example_ of what it would be needed to run :fun_with_flags_ui
  # fully standalone.
